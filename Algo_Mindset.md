# Algorithm Mindset (For interviews as well)

This is a doc of resources for gaining the right mindset when doing algorithms in Interviews.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. You are not expected to know the perfect solution immediately. The journey from starting simple and iterating to optimize your solution shows better understanding then just knowing the best answer right away!

2. ALWAYS THINK OUT LOUD! ALWAY TAKE ABOUT THE TRADE OFFS AND WHAT THE STRATEGY IS!

3. stay calm.

4. Take your time to full understand the problem! (It's not about speed it's about being correct)

5. Ask and think about clarifying questions. (Ask about edge cases, ask about Big 0 constraints)

   - Don't ignore things or make assumptions that are not clarified

6. **_Always walk through the examples with input and outputs._**

7. **_PLAN YOUR SOLUTION WITH PSEUDO CODE OR OTHER WAYS_**. Start by thinking of a brute force solution first so that you understand what is needed.

   - If the array is sorted use binary search instead of linear search.

   - If the same value is computed multiple times consider **PRE-COMPUTING** them with hash tables, sets or prefix, suffix sums.

   - Make space VS time BIG O trade offs to make efficiency constraints.

   - DON'T RUSH. Alway understand what you are going to write. Write a steps guide for your algorithm or pseudocode it.

   - Simplify where possible.

   - Improve Readability.

8. Brainstorm all data structures that can be used to solve the problem.

9. DON'T OVER COMPLICATE THE PROBLEM! SIMPLE SOLUTIONS ARE ALWAYS THE BEST SOLUTIONS!

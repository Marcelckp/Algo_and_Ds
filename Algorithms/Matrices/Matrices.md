# Matrix

Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns.

They are used in various fields such as computer graphics, physics, and statistics. Here are some common algorithms used to solve matrix problems:

1. **Matrix Addition and Subtraction**: These operations are performed element-wise, meaning corresponding elements of the matrices are added or subtracted.

2. **Matrix Multiplication**: This involves multiplying rows of the first matrix by columns of the second matrix and summing the products.

3. **Matrix Inversion**: The inverse of a matrix is a matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, yields the identity matrix. Not all matrices have inverses.

4. **Gaussian Elimination**: This algorithm is used to solve systems of linear equations. It transforms the matrix into an upper triangular form, making it easier to solve.

5. **Matrix Transpose**: The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows with its columns. This means that the element at row `i` and column `j` in the original matrix will be at row `j` and column `i` in the transposed matrix.

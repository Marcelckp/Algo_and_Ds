# Greedy Algorithm

These are algorithms that take into account the direct local optimization at each level in attempt to optimize the entire algorithm solution.

The optimizations locally may change the function to make the solution less optimal overall however greedy algorithms have this goal despite the end solution being less optimal.

**_Greedy algorithms are more of a conceptual approach to solving algorithms then being an algorithm themselves._**

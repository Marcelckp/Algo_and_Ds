# DAG -> Directed Acyclic Graph

<br>

### What is this?

<br>

In mathematics, particularly graph theory, and computer science, a ***Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)*** is a ***Directed Graph*** with no directed cycles. 

It consists of Vertices and Edges *(also called arcs)*, with each Edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following those directions will **never form a closed loop**.

A directed graph is a DAG if and only if it can be topologically ordered, by arranging the vertices as a linear ordering that is consistent with all edge directions.

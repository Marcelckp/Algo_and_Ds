# Graphs

Graphs is in itself a data structure and it is a common umberella term for all the other node and leaf types of data structures:

- [Binary Trees](../BinaryTree/)

- [N-ary Tress](../N-arrTree/)

- [BST Trees](../BinarySearchTree/)

- [Decision Trees](../DecisionTree/)

- [Tries](../Tries/)

These are all variants within the graph family.

## What does Graph refer to when we group these terms

A graph is a collection of nodes (or vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.

When we group terms like Binary Trees, N-ary Trees, BST Trees, Decision Trees, and Tries under the umbrella of graphs, we are referring to the fact that these data structures can be represented as graphs.

Each of these structures consists of nodes connected by edges, forming a network of relationships that can be analyzed and traversed in various ways.

- Binary Trees: A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.

- N-ary Trees: A tree in which each node can have up to N children.

- BST Trees: A binary tree in which nodes are arranged in a specific order, typically for efficient searching.

- Decision Trees: A tree used for decision-making processes, where each node represents a decision point.

- Tries: A tree-like data structure used for storing associative data, often used in searching algorithms.

**_These structures are all specialized forms of graphs, tailored for specific applications and operations._**

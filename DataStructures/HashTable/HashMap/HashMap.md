# Hash Map

The hash map is one of the implementations of a map which is used to store (key, value) pairs.

We can store many values at a single key location using lists / arrays - but theres keys have to be unique.

In short its an object that maps keys to values. Maps also cannot contain duplicate keys although each key can map to at most one value of which can be anything from objects to arrays, to store more values at a particular key basically working as a work around for this map rule.

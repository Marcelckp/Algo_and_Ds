# Hash Map

The hash map is one of the implementations of a map which is used to store (key, value) pairs.

We can store many values at a single key location using lists / arrays - but theres keys have to be unique.

An object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys.

each key can map to at most one value of which can be anything from objects to arrays.

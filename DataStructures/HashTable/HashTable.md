# Hash Table

Hash Table is a data structure which organizes data using hash functions in order to support quick insertion and search.

There are two different kinds of hash tables: 

- The hash ***set*** is one of the implementations of a set data structure to store no repeated values.

- The hash ***map*** is one of the implementations of a map data structure to store (key, value) pairs.

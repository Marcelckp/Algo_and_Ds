# Hash Table

Hash Table is a data structure which organizes data using hash functions in order to support quick insertion and search.

There are two different kinds of hash tables:

- The hash **_set_** is one of the implementations of a set data structure to store no repeated values.

- The hash **_map_** is one of the implementations of a map data structure to store (key, value) pairs.

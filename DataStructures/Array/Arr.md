# Array

## What is an array

An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by an index or key.

Arrays are used to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.

Each element in an array is of the same data type, and the size of the array is fixed once it is created. Arrays provide fast access to elements since the index allows for direct access to any element in constant time, O(1).

### Under the hood

An array is a continuous block of memory where each element is stored sequentially. This allows for efficient access to elements using their index, as the index can be used to calculate the memory address of any element directly.
